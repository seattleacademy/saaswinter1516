I plan to attend the Navi Academy which has the 3rd lowest acceptance rate in the country. I weigh 137 and am 5'5 and can't wait to start my carrer in the Navi. This will be an amazing expierence and I cannot wait to begin. I have many nicknames for myself such as "Swoleasaurs Rex", "Manlet", "Navi the Dwarf", and last but not least "Castle of Swole" I hope you enjoy my website and get to know me. I also have many friends such as a fellow asian boy named Ian Lock. This man has helped me through so much from getting across the border to carrying me all the way to where I am today.  </p>

  <h3 class="margin">What I like to do?</h3>
  <p>I enjoy many different things in ilfe but one of my favorite is sitting down and playing a good game of competitive Counter Strike. Sadly, as of a few weeks ago I maxed out not only my mums, but also my dad's credit cards. We as a family are on the run from the Mexican Border police and the CIA, for unpaid debts. If you have any free skins as donations, I would be overjoyed if you donated them, as I could sell them on Paypal to feed myself with Burritos and keep myself in a healthy manner. Burritos are well known for keeping professionals like me in top form, for the hope of making it out of GN3, and the almighty dream of making it in the MG1. Please let me know, my family and I are starving </p>
  </a>
  <div class="container-fluid bg-5 text-center">
  <h3 class="margin">What else I like to do</h3>
  <p>Another activity I enjoy very much is going to the gym. I excel in extreme swoleness and my tip top shape has gotten me into Navel Academy. As you can see from the pictures below I went through an extreme change within 2 weeks of my new workout program. I had to survive on my own survival instincts and my goal was to become the most elite workout god ever. I wanted them to look at me like I was the president of swole. I wanted them to look at me like I had conquered the mountain of obeisty and was on my way to swole city. I will be releasing my workout video soon stay tuned ;)
